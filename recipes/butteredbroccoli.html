        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Frozen Broccoli</li>
            <li>Stick butter</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Six <em>Easy</em> Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Go ahead and pour some of the frozen Broccoli into a <strong>microwave safe</strong>
                bowl
            </li>
        
            <li>
                Pour some water into the bowl, the amount varies with how much broccoli you'll
                be making, use around <em>three</em> tablespoons to start out
            </li>

            <li>Cover the bowl with a <strong>microwave safe</strong> plate or something similar</li>

            <li>
                Put it in the microwave for about 5 minutes, however <strong>watch it closely!</strong>
                 as cooking time varies with the power of your microwave and too long will burn it.
            </li>

            <li>Take it out after its nice and fork tender and throw in about 1 tablespoon of butter and mix</li>
            <li>Now that the butter is melted and is coating the broccoli now throw in your seasoning to taste and mix</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Done!</h2>
