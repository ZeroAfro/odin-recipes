        <h1>French "Style" Scrambled Eggs!</h1>

        <p>
            This is <strong>MY</strong> take on the French style-<em>ish</em> scrambled eggs, I say my take because<br>
            I change it up just a tiny bit for my own personal taste but it's roughly the<br>
            exact same! So if you are looking for strictly french scrambled eggs than this<br>
            recipe isn't for you. This recipe assumes you know how to make scrambled eggs already.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
            <l1>Cream Cheese</l1>
            <l1>Butter</l1>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Four <em>Easy</em> Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack your eggs into a bowl and give them a good whisk and pour them into a pan on the stove and turn it on to <strong>medium heat</strong>></li>
            <li>
                Throw in <strong>half</strong> a tablespoon of butter and start stirring with a spatula and If you notice it starting to cling to the bottom of the pan feel<br>
                free to pull it off the heat for a few seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once its <em>lightly scrambled</em> pull it off the heat and throw in a decent chunk of cream cheese, this part is personal preference for how much but I do a nice<br>
                chunk my self.
            </li>
            <li>Stir it in and then place it back on the heat and let it melt into the scrambled eggs</li>
            <li>Take the pan off the heat once the cream cheese is melted in and the eggs look like they are nearing done</li>
            <li>Throw in some shredded cheddar cheese and <strong>mix it while it's off the heat</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Done!</h2>
        <p>
            There you have it! A lot of this recipe is up to personal feeling so feel free to<br>
            mix and match with different cheeses or cream cheeses. You can even throw in onions or<br>
            other things like hot sauce to really <em>spice</em> it up!
